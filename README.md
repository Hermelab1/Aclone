0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

A command interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines.
we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	Update attributes of an object
	Destroy an object
